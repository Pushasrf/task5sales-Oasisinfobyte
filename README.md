Task-5 Sales Prediction using Python
Sales Prediction typically focuses on using historical sales data to develop predictive models. It likely involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and the implementation of machine learning algorithms to forecast future sales. The kernel may showcase techniques such as feature engineering, model evaluation, and optimization to improve prediction accuracy, making it a valuable resource for those interested in data science and retail analytics.
